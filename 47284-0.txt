    The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn.
    Where's the little boy that tends the sheep?
       He's under the haycock fast asleep.=

    Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,
    Threescore men and threescore more
    Cannot place Humpty Dumpty as he was before.


    Curly Locks! Curly Locks! wilt thou be mine?
    Thou shalt not wash dishes, nor yet feed the swine;
    But sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam,
    And feast upon strawberries, sugar, and cream!


    There was an old woman lived under the hill,
    And if she's not gone, she's living there still.
    Baked apples she sold, and cranberry pies;
    And she's the old woman that never told lies.


    Hark! Hark! the dogs do bark,
    The beggars have come to town;
    Some in rags, and some in tags,
    And some in velvet gowns.


    Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man!
    So I do, master, as fast as I can.
    Pat it and prick it and mark it with B,
    And toss it in the oven for Baby and me.


      A diller, a dollar,
      A ten o'clock scholar,
    What makes you come so soon?
    You used to come at ten o'clock,
    And now you come at noon.


    One misty, moisty morning,
    When cloudy was the weather,
    I chanced to meet an old man
    Clothed all in leather.

      He began to compliment,
      And I began to grin;
      How do you do, and how do you do?
      And how do you do again?

    I like little pussy, her coat is so warm,--
    And if I don't hurt her she'll do me no harm;
    I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
    But pussy and I very gently will play.


    Little Tommy Tucker,
    Sing for your supper:
    What shall I eat?
    White bread and butter.
    How shall I cut it
    Without any knife?
    How shall I marry
    Without any wife?


    There was a Piper had a Cow,
      And he had naught to give her;
    He pulled out his pipes and played her a tune,
      And bade the cow consider.

    The Cow considered very well,
      And gave the Piper a penny,
    And bade him play the other tune:
      "Corn rigs are bonny."


    =Mary Mary quite contrary
     How does your garden grow?
     Silver bells and cockle shells
     And pretty maids all in a row.=

    Ride a cock-horse to Banbury-Cross
      To see what Tommy can buy;
    A penny white loaf, a penny white cake,
      And a two-penny apple pie.


    Tom, Tom, the piper's son
    Stole a pig, and away he run;
    The pig was eat and Tom was beat,
    And Tom ran crying down the street.


    Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief,
    Taffy came to my house and stole a leg of beef;
    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy wasn't home;
    Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow bone.
    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed;
    I took the marrow-bone and beat Taffy's head.


    Daffy-down-dilly is new come to town,
    With a petticoat green and a bright yellow gown.


    Pease porridge hot,
    Pease porridge cold,
    Pease porridge in the pot
      Nine days old.


        I'll tell you a story
        About Mary Morey,
    And now my story's begun.
        I'll tell you another,
        About her brother,
    And now my story's done.

    Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
    And can't tell where to find them;
    Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
    Wagging their tails behind them.

    Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
    And dreamt she heard them bleating;
    When she awoke, 'twas all a joke--
    Ah! cruel vision so fleeting.

    Then up she took her little crook,
    Determined for to find them;
    What was her joy to behold them nigh,
    Wagging their tails behind them.


    To market, to market,
    To buy a penny bun.
    Home again, home again,
    Market is done.


    The man in the moon came down too soon,
      And asked his way to Norwich;
    He went by the south and burnt his mouth
      With eating cold plum-porridge.


        Hey, diddle, diddle!
        The cat and the fiddle;
    The cow jumped over the moon.
        The little dog laughed
        To see such craft;
    And the dish ran away with the spoon.


    =Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,
          Eating of curds and whey;
     Along came a spider and sat down beside her,
        And frightened Miss Muffet away.=

    When I was a bachelor I lived by myself,
    And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon the shelf.
    The rats and the mice they made such a strife,
    I was forced to go to London to buy me a wife.

    The roads were so bad and the lanes were so narrow,
    I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow.
    The wheelbarrow broke and my wife had a fall--
    Down came wheelbarrow, wife, and all.


    The rose is red, the violet blue;
    Sugar is sweet--and so are you.
    These are the words you bade me say
    For a pair of new gloves on Easter day.


    Great A, little a, bouncing B,
    The cat's in the cupboard and she can't see.


    Hey-ding-a-ding! I heard a bird sing;
    The parliament soldiers are gone to the king.


    There was an old woman tossed up in a basket,
    Seventy times as high as the moon.
    What she did there I could not but ask it,
    For in her hand she carried a broom.

    "Old woman, old woman, old woman," said I,
    "Oh whither, oh whither, oh whither so high?"
    "To sweep the cobwebs off the sky,
    And I shall be back again by and by."


    There was a little man and he had a little gun,
    And his bullets were made of lead,
    He shot John Sprig through the middle of his wig,
    And knocked it right off his head.


    There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile;
    He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile;
    He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse;
    And they all lived together in a little crooked house.

    Cross patch, draw the latch;
    Sit by the fire and spin;
    Take a cup and drink it up,
    Then call your neighbors in.


    Hickory, dickory, dock;
    The mouse ran up the clock;
    The clock struck one,
    The mouse ran down,
    Hickory, dickory, dock.


          "Jack, be nimble,
           Jack, be quick."
    Jack ran off with the pudding-stick.


    There was an old woman
    Sold puddings and pies;
    She went to the mill,
    And the dust flew in her eyes.
    Now through the streets,
    To all she meets,
    She ever cries,
    "Hot pies--Hot pies!"


      =Jack and Jill went up the hill,
         To fetch a pail of water;
    Jack fell down and broke his crown,
       And Jill came tumbling after.=

    Goosey, goosey, gander,
    Where dost thou wander?
    Up stairs and down stairs,
    And in my lady's chamber.
    There I met an old man
    Who would not say his prayers,
    I took him by the hind legs
    And threw him down stairs.


    Higgledy, piggledy, my black hen,
    She lays eggs for gentlemen;
    Sometimes nine, and sometimes ten,
    Higgledy, piggledy, my black hen.


    Little Nancy Etticoat
    In a white petticoat
    And a red nose;
    The longer she stands
    The shorter she grows.


    As I was going to St. Ives
    I met a man with seven wives;
    Each wife had seven sacks,
    In each sack were seven cats,
    And each cat had seven kits.
    Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
    How many were going to St. Ives?


[Illustration]


    Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,
    Had a wife and couldn't keep her.
    He put her in a pumpkin shell,
    And there he kept her very well.

    Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,
    Had another and didn't love her.
    Peter learned to read and spell,
    And then he loved her very well.


      Ding, dong, bell,
      The cat's in the well.
      Who put her in?
      Little Johnny Green.
      Who pulled her out?
      Great Johnny Stout.
    What a naughty boy was that
    To drown poor pussy cat,
    Which never did him any harm,
    But killed the mice in his father's barn.


    =Little Jack Horner sat in a corner
     Eating his Christmas pie.
     He put in his thumb and pulled out a plum
     And said what a good boy am I.=

    Sing a song of sixpence,
    Pocket full of rye;
    Four and twenty blackbirds
    Baked in a pie.
    When the pie was opened
    The birds began to sing--
    Oh, wasn't that a dainty dish
    To set before the king?


    One, two, buckle my shoe;
    Three, four, shut the door;
    Five, six, pick up sticks;
    Seven, eight, lay them straight;
    Nine, ten, a good fat hen;
    Eleven, twelve, who will delve?
    Thirteen, fourteen, maids a courting;
    Fifteen, sixteen, maids in the kitchen;
    Seventeen, eighteen, maids a waiting;
    Nineteen, twenty, I'm very empty.
    Please, mamma, give me some dinner.

      Ladybug, ladybug,
      Fly away home,
      Your house is on fire,
    And your children will burn.


    Lucy Locket lost her pocket,
      Kitty Fisher found it;
    Never a penny was there in it,
      Save the binding 'round it.


    Three wise men of Gotham
    Went to sea in a bowl.
    If the bowl had been stronger,
    My song had been longer.


    There was a mad man,
    And he had a mad wife,
    And they lived all in a mad lane.
    They had three children all at a birth,
    And they too were mad every one.
    The father was mad,
    The mother was mad,
    The children all mad beside;
    And upon a mad horse they all of them got,
    And madly away did ride.


    Bye, Baby Bunting,
    Father's gone a hunting,
    To get a little rabbit skin
    To wrap the Baby Bunting in.


    Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
    Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full:
    One for the master, one for the dame,
    And one for the little boy who lives in the lane.


    Hey, rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub,
      And who do you think were there?
    The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,
      And all had come from the fair.


    Hush-a-bye baby on the tree top,
    When the wind blows the cradle will rock,
    When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,
    Down will come baby, bough, cradle, and all.
